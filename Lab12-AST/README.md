# Solution
We start by defining an AST node. In C style, it will be:
```c
typedef struct node{
	  int isOp; //Decides if it is an operator or not
	  int val; //0 for addition, 1 for subtraction, 2 for multiplication and 3 for division, //however we consider it only if isOp = 1, else it holds the number
	  struct node *left; //The left child node
	  struct node *right; //The right child node
  }node;
```
The grammar is then simply:
```
Start:  E -> E + T {E.val = new PlusNode(E.val, T.val) }
Here, by PlusNode we refer to creating a node with isOp set to 1 (true) and type set to 0. Similarly, MinusNode, MultNode and DivNode will have isOp = 1 and type = 1, 2 and 3 respectively
| E -> E ‚Äì T { E.val = new MinusNode(E.val, T.val) }
| T { E.val = T.val}
 T -> T * F {T.val = new MultNode(T.val, F.val)}
    | T / F {T.val = new DivNode(T.val, F.val)}  
    | F  {T.val=F.val} 
 F -> NUMBER {F.val = new ValNode}
For valnode, left and right are NULL as AST stops at numbers. Also, isOp = 0 (false) so type holds the actual value of the number 
 | (NUMBER) {F.val = number} //That is, the actual numerical value
  Using this, we write a simple preorder traversal of tree as follows:
```
## How does this work?
Note, for each semantic action, we are creating an AST node with symbol as root and expressions as subtrees. With that in mind, we get:
Let expression to parse = ```5 + 6 * 7``` 
**Parser actions**: ```Start -> E -> E + T -> E + T * F -> T + T * T -> F + F * F```
## AST construction:
We walk backwards. All the literals ‚ÄòF‚Äô create the **ASTNode** *ValNode*, and then ```T + T * T``` gets *PlusNode* and *MultNode* respectively by their semantic actions. Also, *PlusNode* is processed earlier, followed by *MultNode* as is the order in the syntax tree.
**Output**: `1+ 5 * 6 7`

## 3-Address Code
The 3 address code construction is much simpler. The grammar here is: (For the old version. Go to Lab13 readme for the better version's explanation)
```
Start -> Letter ‚Äò=‚Äô Expression, i.e of the form a = b op c op ‚Ä¶ op z. The associated semantic action is {$$=addToTable($1, $3, ‚Äò=‚Äô)} 
Now, Expression (E) is defined as: 
E -> E + E {$$=addToTable($1, $3, ‚Äò+‚Äô)}
| E ‚Äì E {$$=addToTable($1, $3, ‚Äò-‚Äô)}
| E * E {$$=addToTable($1, $3, ‚Äò*‚Äô)}
| E / E {$$=addToTable($1, $3, ‚Äò/‚Äô)}
| ( E ) {$$=$2}
|NUMBER {$$ = (char)$1;} 
|LETTER {(char)$1;}; *//That is, numbers and operators are returned unchanged*
```
Now, this is written in pure YACC style, but here all \$$ is referring to is the result (LHS), while \$1, \$2‚Ä¶\$n refers to the RHS tokens, in order. So, what is happening is the following: Since in 3-address-code we can only have 3 operators in RHS at maximum, everytime we find that, we add that subcomponent to a table (done by function addToTable()) and return their result ($$) as a new token to be processed further and to be consumed by other nodes.

Let expression to parse: `a = 5+6*7` 
*Parser actions*: `Start -> Letter = E -> a = E -> a = E + E -> a = E + E * E -> a = NUMBER + NUMBER * NUMBER`

- In step 1, we insert (‚ÄòLetter‚Äô, ‚ÄòExpression‚Äô, ‚Äò=‚Äô) in table.
- In step 2, we do E -> E + E, so table gets entry (‚ÄòE‚Äô, ‚ÄôE‚Äô, ‚Äò+‚Äô) and returned result is ‚ÄòB‚Äô
- So in step 3, we have E -> A * E, which causes entry (‚ÄòA‚Äô, ‚ÄòE‚Äô, ‚Äò*‚Äô) to be inserted in table and returned result is ‚ÄòC‚Äô. 
- However, we must remember that these semantic actions can only be performed after the parsing is complete (for LR grammars), o the ‚ÄòE‚Äô and ‚ÄòA‚Äô are now filled with the return values after their expansion into terminal token NUMBER. So, the table actually has:
```
A = 6 * 7
B = 5 + A // Since the * nodes are expanded at a later stage, they come earlier when recursion backtracking starts
```

## DAG construction:
The DAG construction is pretty simple too. The node structure is similar to ast, except an additional attribute, **id**:
```c
typedef struct node{
    int isOp; //Decides if it is an operator or not
	int val; //0 for addition, 1 for subtraction, 2 for multiplication and 3 for division, //however we consider it only if isOp = 1, else it holds the number
    int id; //Stores the value at this node in symbol table array
    struct node *left; //The left child node
    struct node *right; //The right child node
  }node;
```

What we do is as follows: When we are at a terminal (for simplicity, here terminals are single characters, `a-z`), we push that value to symbol table. Now, whenever we visit a node with an expression rule (say, `E -> E + E`), we first check if that value has already been computed or not by traversing through symbol table: if yes, we set it to that value and return, else we make a new node, push the value to symbol table and return.

Let expression to parse: `a*b+c+a*b` 
*Parser actions*: `ArithmeticExpression -> E -> E * E -> E * E + E -> E * E + E + E -> E * E + E + E * E ... (all changed to IDs)
Now, when we first get a*b, it will not be in table, but when we again go to a*b, it will be there, so we will not make the new node and just push it directly`


**Note**: Compilation
-  lex ast.l & yacc -d ast.y & gcc ast.tab.c  
-  lex 3address.l & yacc -d 3address.y & gcc 3address.tab.c  
-  lex 3address(old).l & yacc -d 3address(old).y & gcc lex.yy.c 3address(old).tab.c for the older versions. *Footnote: 3address_1.y has a simpler version that prints symbols as it sees them and is probably more intuitive. To make it work, change the second line in `3address(old).l` to `# include 3address_1.tab.h"`)*
- lex dag.l & yacc -d dag.y & gcc dag.tab.c

Replace ast.tab.c, dag.tab.c and 3address.tab.c with y.tab.c on linux üòÅ

**Note 3:**

The *DAG* code can only optimize nodes that appear in the tree order, so `a*b+c+a*b` will be optimized, but `a+b+c+a+b` will not be, as it fails to identify the common sub-expression `a+b` due to the linear tree. To handle that, the code called **transformInput.py** is given, which attempts to identify such common sub-expressions and place brackets around them, so that the linear nature is broken.

*Usage Example*: 
- echo a+b+c+a+b | python transformInput.py | dag 
- echo a+b+c+a+b * (a+b) | python transformInput.py | dag 

Use only the first pipe to see the intermediate python output
